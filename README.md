## CustomKeyboard

Provide Previous, Next, Done buttons for iOS keyboard

## Usage

The CustomKeyboard class has a delegate class CustomKeyboardDelegate. Any class requiring the CustomKeyboard implementation will need to implement the delegate functions. These functions are:

1.) This function will receive a call when the user clicks on the next button. The selectedId is the integer value of which textbox the user was in BEFORE clicking next.

```objective-c
(void)nextClicked:(NSUInteger)selectedId;
```

2.) This function will be called when the user clicks on previous. The variable selectedId will have the id of the box that the user was on before clicking previous.

```objective-c
(void)previousClicked:(NSUInteger)selectedId;
```

3.) This function will be called when the user clicks on done.

```objective-c
(void)doneClicked:(NSUInteger)selectedId;
```


After implementing the three delegate functions, create an instance of the CustomKeyboard class and assign the delegate to that object (i.e. customKeyboard.delegate = self;).

When showing a keyboard for a particular box, inside the textFieldDidBeginEditing function, the following functions are available to create the toolbar above the keyboard:

1.) Generate a UIToolbar with Previous, Next, and Done. The variables prevEnabled and nextEnabled define if the buttons should be enabled or not (i.e. first box won't have previous enabled).

```objective-c
(UIToolbar *)getToolbarWithPrevNextDone:(BOOL)prevEnabled :(BOOL)nextEnabled;
```

2.) Generate a UIToolbar with only the Done button.

```objective-c
(UIToolbar *)getToolbarWithDone;
```
	

The functions above can be used in the following way:

```objective-c
[textField setInputAccessoryView:[customKeyboard getToolbarWithPrevNextDone:FALSE :TRUE]];
```

This would show Previous, Next, and Done. Previous button would be disabled.
